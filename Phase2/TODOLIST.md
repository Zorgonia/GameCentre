The plans are to finish implementing all the unfinished sections of Phase 1. This includes allowing players to choose
complexity, allowing scores to be displayed correctly. Code may also need to be refactored as progress is made. Most
other concepts have also been implemented, including basic undo features, saving and loading to different files,
accounts and related functions, as well as autosave.
